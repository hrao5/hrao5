What
does it m ean to me to be a James Scholar
James scholar, as an honor
s prog ram, represents the top students in our college and it s
recognition to my achievements. I believe I m capable of being a top student in my campus and I
want to be better and better, so I decided to apply for this program, to be part of it.
The first time for me to hear
of James Scholar is by accident. W hen I was checking the locati on of
my freshman year housing, I found the Honor s LLC and that reminds me of something deep
inside my mind
I wasn
t a student goo d enough for being a James Scholar, and that s why I need to self nominate
for this honor now . My high school performance is awful because I didn t know what study really
means to me, and I didn t care my GPA. T ha t is now proved to be a vital mistake, and I lost my
best friend out of my ignorance . As a result, m y high school didn t end up happi ly. But a ll those
happened fi nally changed me, I started to realize what I really care and how much effor t s I must
give. When I apply to this campus, I said I m fascinated by the vast of knowledge, but I wasn t
pre pared for my dream. I was interested in almost everything but I didn t spent enough t ime on
everything I interested in. The most important thing I learned during my high school years is no
pain no gain. N ow I start to pay efforts , to l earn as much as I can, trying to get mysel f on the r ight
track . Though I don t know whether I can finally be the person I wanted to be, I ll keep fighting
for it without a doubt. In that way, I can say I worth my life when I m old. And to be a James
Scholar is somehow a proof of my efforts, which would motivate me to strive for my goal. To me,
to be a James Scholar means not only an honor, bu t also the sword of Damocles, reminding me of
everything I lost and all the pain I must give to earn my own future
